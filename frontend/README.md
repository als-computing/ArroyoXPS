# Getting Started 

This app provides several canvases and plot.js plots for viewing data from a websocket. The canvases are made to render data from base 64 encoded jpeg. The plots are made to generate a Gaussian distribution based on the X position of peak, Y peak value, and Full Width Half Max value.


## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
